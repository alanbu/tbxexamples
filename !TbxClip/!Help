This example shows how to use TBX with the RISC OS global clipboard.

Run the application and then press select on the iconbar icon to show a window.
You can show multiple copies of the window by repeating this.

Pressing select in a window will give it the focus.

The window consists of three areas from which you can copy and paste.
Pressing select on one area will highlight it with a red box and make it the
target for a copy or paste operation.

The top area will copy text to the clipboard and paste the first 64 characters
of any text in the clipboard to it.

The middle area allows the copying and pasting of a sprite. It stores the whole
sprite, but only the bottom left corner is shown if the sprite is larger than
the area.

The bottom area allows pasting of text. When copying it will add the text and 
a simple sprite version of the text to the clipboard.

The buttons at the bottom are:

Copy - copy the selected area to the clipboard
Paste - paste the current value of the clipboard to the selected area (if the
clipboard contains the correct format).
Check - Check the clipboard to see if it currently contains text or sprite data.

Note: as clipboard support uses the standard tbx loader methods, you can also
update any of the areas by dragging data of the appropriate type to them.
